The Hodgkin-Huxley Equation describes the behavior of electrical charge in a neuron during the firing of an action potential. This Python simulation approximates the time-dependent solution to the equation using a 4th-order Runge-Kutta algorithm.

I completed this project for my Bioelectricity course at Purdue University. I am the author of this program, but credit is due to Dr. Pedro Irazoqui for providing a framework for this simulation.

Please note: This simulation is dependent on NumPy and Matplotlib for certain mathematical and plotting functionality.
